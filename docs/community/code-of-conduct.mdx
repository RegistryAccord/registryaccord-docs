# Code of Conduct

RegistryAccord is an open, diverse community of builders. To keep the community welcoming and productive, everyone is expected to follow this Code of Conduct in all project spaces.

:::tip Single source of truth
Canonical Code of Conduct:  
https://github.com/RegistryAccord/registryaccord-specs/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

This page is a concise overview. Each RA repo should link to the canonical file and add only repo‑specific contacts if needed.

## Our pledge

We pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

- Be respectful, inclusive, and constructive.  
- Focus on what is best for the community and the project.  
- Accept constructive feedback gracefully; disagree without being disagreeable.  
- Avoid sexualized language and imagery and unwelcome advances.  
- Do not insult, troll, or harass; respect people’s time and attention.  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include harassment, threats, discriminatory jokes or language, public or private harassment, publishing others’ private information without permission, and other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Responsibilities

- Contributors and maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.  
- Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.  

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples include using an official e‑mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

- Report incidents to the project team at: info@registryaccord.com.  
- All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.  
- The project team will maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.  
- Enforcement actions may include warnings, temporary bans, or permanent exclusion from the community, at the maintainers’ discretion.  

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is aligned with widely used community standards. The canonical policy, including detailed enforcement guidelines and maintainer responsibilities, is maintained centrally in the specs repo.
