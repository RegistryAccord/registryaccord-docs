# Mission

RegistryAccord's mission is centered on three core principles that empower creators in the digital landscape:

## Creator Ownership

Creators should retain full ownership of their work, their audience, and the economics of their business. Traditional platforms often lock creators into proprietary ecosystems that limit their autonomy and extract value from their efforts.

## Data and Identity Portability

Creators should be able to move their digital presence seamlessly between services and platforms without losing their identity, content, or connections. Data portability ensures creators are not trapped in walled gardens.

## Sustainable Economics

The protocol should enable sustainable economic models that fairly compensate creators for their value creation while providing transparent and equitable revenue sharing.

## Who Benefits

This mission benefits:

- **Creators**: Independent artists, writers, musicians, and content creators who want control over their digital presence
- **App Developers**: Builders who want to create interoperable applications without reinventing identity and content infrastructure
- **Infra Operators**: Organizations that want to provide decentralized infrastructure services

By focusing on these principles, RegistryAccord aims to create an open, interoperable foundation where creators can build and maintain their independent digital identity while enjoying the benefits of a connected ecosystem.
