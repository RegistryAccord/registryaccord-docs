# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to RegistryAccord (RA)! This page explains how to propose changes, file issues, submit code/docs, and participate in governance. There are two builder paths: contribute to the RA protocol and tooling, or build apps/services on top of RA. Both benefit from a clear, open process.

:::tip Single source of truth
To avoid drift, the canonical contribution guide lives in the specs repo:
https://github.com/RegistryAccord/registryaccord-specs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

This page is a thin overview. Each RA repo should point to the canonical document and include only repo‑specific addenda (e.g., language toolchain, make targets).
:::

## Ways to contribute

- Specs and schemas: OpenAPI 3.1, JSON/JSON‑LD examples, version headers, error envelopes.
- Reference services: Identity, Content Registry, Storage Gateway, Payments, Feeds, Revenue, Analytics.
- SDKs: TypeScript/JS, Python, Go — typed clients, pagination, retries, idempotency, errors.
- Conformance: test harness, fixtures, compatibility badges, CI integration.
- Infra: docker‑compose, Helm/Terraform, local/dev and staging blueprints.
- Docs: quickstarts, examples, runbooks, diagrams, migration guides.

## Getting started

1. Read the Architecture, Installation, and Quickstart pages to run the local stack.
2. Browse open issues labeled good first issue or help wanted.
3. For significant changes, start an RFC before coding to align early.
4. Reach out if you want to coordinate on an area: info@registryaccord.com.

## Issues

- Bug report: expected vs actual, repro steps, logs, versions, minimal payloads.
- Feature request: problem statement, target users, proposed API changes, alternatives.
- Docs: missing sections, unclear examples, diagrams, quickstarts.
- Security: do not open public issues; use responsible disclosure (see Security below).

Labels commonly used: type/bug, type/feature, type/docs, good first issue, help wanted, area/*, svc/*, sdk/*, spec.

## RFC process (for non‑trivial changes)

- Start with a concise proposal:
  - Problem statement and motivation.
  - Design overview with diagrams as needed.
  - API/Schema diffs (OpenAPI/JSON examples).
  - Semantics and error handling.
  - Migration and deprecation impact.
  - Security, privacy, and compliance notes.
  - Alternatives considered.
  - Rollout plan and conformance updates.
- Expect at least one maintainer review and community feedback before implementation.

## Development workflow

- Fork and branch: feature/short-slug or fix/short-slug.
- Commit style: Conventional Commits recommended (e.g., feat(identity): add org membership APIs).
- Tests:
  - Unit tests for business logic.
  - Contract tests against OpenAPI examples.
  - Conformance tests for cross‑service behavior.
- Lint/format:
  - Go: go fmt, golangci-lint.
  - TS/JS: eslint, prettier, typecheck.
  - Python: ruff/flake8, black, mypy.
- Keep PRs small and focused; include docs and examples alongside code.

## PR checklist

- [ ] Linked issue or RFC.
- [ ] API/Schema updated (OpenAPI/JSON) with examples.
- [ ] Tests added/updated (unit, contract, conformance where applicable).
- [ ] Docs updated (quickstart, examples, runbooks, diagrams as needed).
- [ ] Lint/format pass; CI green.
- [ ] Backwards compatibility reviewed; deprecation notes included if needed.
- [ ] Changelog entry (if repo maintains one).

## Reviews and merging

- At least one maintainer approval.
- All required checks must pass (lint, unit, contract, conformance).
- Squash merge recommended for clarity; preserve meaningful commit messages.

## Versioning and deprecations

- Additive‑first: prefer adding fields/endpoints over changing/removing.
- Explicit versions in REST paths and schemas (e.g., v1).
- Deprecation windows include timelines, migration steps, and fixtures.
- Conformance updated in lockstep with spec changes.

## Security

- Responsible disclosure: email security reports to info@registryaccord.com.
- Do not file public issues for vulnerabilities.
- Include affected components, versions, PoC, and impact.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive. Harassment and disruptive behavior are not tolerated.
- See CODE_OF_CONDUCT in each repo; violations can lead to restrictions on participation.

## Licensing and IP

- Apache‑2.0 for RA repos; contributions are accepted under the same license.
- Preserve NOTICE and attribution where present.
- Contributor terms:
  - DCO (Signed‑off‑by) or CLA, as specified by each repo.
  - Ensure you have rights to contribute the code/content you submit.

## Repo‑specific addenda (template)

Each repo may append details like:

- Language/runtime versions and toolchains.
- Make targets or npm/pip tasks (e.g., make test, make lint, make conformance).
- Local environment variables and service ports.
- Release process (tags, artifacts, registries).

## For app/service builders

- Build against public specs and SDKs to keep portability.
- Use the conformance harness to validate before release; publish compatibility badges.
- Plan for upgrades by tracking deprecations and version headers.

## For maintainers

- Triage regularly; label clearly; avoid issue stagnation.
- Demand artifacts in proposals (spec diffs, examples, tests) to reduce ambiguity.
- Prefer small, iterative PRs; guide contributors to split when necessary.
- Communicate timelines for breaking changes and provide migration aids.

## FAQ

- Should this page duplicate CONTRIBUTING.md?  
  No. Keep a single canonical CONTRIBUTING.md in the specs repo. Each repo links to it and adds only repo‑specific details. This docs page remains a high‑level overview.

- Can I contribute a feature that’s “commercial” in nature?  
  Yes, as long as it fits public extension points or goes through RFC if it affects protocol contracts. No private protocol features.

- How do I get help or mentorship?  
  Open a draft PR early and tag maintainers, or email info@registryaccord.com with your area of interest.
