# Protocol vs Implementation

**RegistryAccord** is an **open protocol specification**, not a single implementation. This distinction is critical to understanding the ecosystem.

## What is RegistryAccord?

**RegistryAccord is the specification, not the implementation.**

### RegistryAccord Defines:
- ✅ API contracts (OpenAPI 3.1 specifications)
- ✅ Data models (JSON schemas)
- ✅ Authentication patterns (OAuth2, WebAuthn)
- ✅ Event schemas (lifecycle events)
- ✅ Conformance criteria (what makes a valid implementation)

### RegistryAccord Does NOT Define:
- ❌ How to implement the services (Node.js? Go? Rust? Your choice)
- ❌ Where to host (AWS? GCP? On-prem? Your choice)
- ❌ Which database to use (Postgres? MySQL? Mongo? Your choice)
- ❌ UI/UX (design your own apps)

**Think of RegistryAccord like HTTP or Email:**
- HTTP is a protocol, Apache/Nginx are implementations
- SMTP is a protocol, Gmail/Outlook are implementations
- **RegistryAccord is a protocol, many implementations are possible**

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Protocol (RegistryAccord) | Implementations |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **What it is** | Specification | Working services |
| **Governance** | Community (TSC, RFC) | Implementation-specific |
| **License** | Apache 2.0 | Varies by provider |
| **Cost** | Free to use | Varies by provider |
| **Implementation** | Specified, not built | Actual running code |
| **Support** | Community forums | Provider-dependent |
| **Updates** | RFC process | Provider schedule |

---

## Why This Matters

### For Builders

You have **multiple options**:

**1. Use a Hosted Provider** - Fastest path to market
- Managed services, no ops burden
- Professional SDKs and support
- Enterprise features available
- Pay for what you use

**2. Self-Host** - Maximum control
- Implement specs yourself
- Run on your infrastructure
- Customize as needed
- No vendor fees

**3. Mix & Match** - Hybrid approach
- Use Provider A for Identity
- Self-host Content services
- Use Provider B for Payments
- Swap providers without breaking your app

### For Creators

Your **data is portable**:
- Identity (DID) works with any RA provider
- Content published once, available everywhere
- Audience follows you across platforms
- You're not locked into any single provider

### For the Ecosystem

**Competition drives quality**:
- Multiple providers compete on features/price
- Innovation happens at every layer
- Network effects benefit everyone
- No single point of failure

---

## Conformance

### How Do You Know a Service is RA-Compliant?

**Conformance Testing** (coming soon):
- Automated test harness validates implementations
- Services earn conformance badges
- Public dashboard shows compliance status
- Non-compliant services can't claim RA compatibility

**What Conformance Means:**
- ✅ API contracts match OpenAPI specs
- ✅ Authentication flows work correctly
- ✅ Data models are compatible
- ✅ Events follow schema definitions

---

## Implementation Models

### Commercial SaaS
**Characteristics:**
- Hosted services with SLAs
- Professional support
- Enterprise features
- Usage-based pricing
- Managed updates

**Examples:**
- Managed identity services
- Hosted content registries
- Payment processing platforms

### Open Source / Community
**Characteristics:**
- Self-hosted deployments
- Community support
- Customizable features
- Free to use
- DIY updates

**Examples:**
- Community-maintained services
- Open source reference implementations
- Educational projects

### Enterprise Self-Hosted
**Characteristics:**
- Full control over deployment
- Custom integrations
- On-premise or private cloud
- Internal support teams
- Custom SLAs

**Examples:**
- Large enterprises with compliance requirements
- Organizations with data sovereignty needs
- Custom business logic requirements

---

## Future: Foundation Model

**Current Phase:** Community-maintained specifications  
**Future Phase:** Neutral foundation governance  

### Planned Foundation Will:
- Own the RegistryAccord trademark
- Govern spec evolution (TSC, RFC process)
- Run conformance testing program
- Accept corporate members
- Fund ecosystem development
- Ensure long-term neutrality

### Implementation Providers Will:
- Build conformant services
- Compete on features and pricing
- Contribute to foundation
- Pay for conformance certification
- Participate in governance

**Timeline:** Foundation formation when ecosystem reaches critical mass (post-launch).

## Analogy: Email

This relationship mirrors email:

| Email Ecosystem | RegistryAccord Ecosystem |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| **SMTP Protocol** | RA Specification |
| **Gmail** | Hosted Provider #1 |
| **Outlook** | Hosted Provider #2 |
| **Self-hosted mail server** | Self-hosted RA services |
| **Standards body (IETF)** | RA Foundation (future) |

Just like you can send email from Gmail to Outlook, creators and builders can move between RA implementations without friction.

## FAQ

### Can I build my own RA implementation?

**Yes!** That's the entire point. RegistryAccord is Apache 2.0 licensed and anyone can implement it.

### Do I need permission to build an RA service?

**No.** The specs are open. You can build and operate RA-compliant services without asking anyone.

### Will different implementations work together?

**Yes**, if they're conformant. That's guaranteed by the specifications and enforced by conformance testing.

### Who decides changes to the protocol?

**The community**, through the RFC process and TSC governance. No single company controls it.

### Can I mix providers?

**Yes!** Use different providers for different services. The specs ensure interoperability.

### What if a provider shuts down?

Your data is portable. Export your content and move to another provider or self-host.

### How do I know which providers to trust?

Look for conformance certification and community reputation. The foundation (when formed) will help with this.

## Summary

**RegistryAccord is:**
- ✅ An open protocol specification
- ✅ Apache 2.0 licensed
- ✅ Community-governed
- ✅ Implementation-agnostic

**RegistryAccord is NOT:**
- ❌ A single service or platform
