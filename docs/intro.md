# RegistryAccord Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for RegistryAccord, an open protocol that enables creators to own their work, their audience, and the economics of their business.

## What is RegistryAccord?

RegistryAccord is a decentralized protocol designed to give creators full ownership and control over their digital presence. Unlike traditional platforms that lock creators into proprietary ecosystems, RegistryAccord provides an open, interoperable foundation where creators can build and maintain their independent digital identity.

## Key Features

- **Creator Ownership**: Creators retain full ownership of their content, audience, and data
- **Decentralized Identity**: Built on DID (Decentralized Identifiers) for portable identity
- **Open Standards**: Based on open protocols and specifications
- **Interoperability**: Works across different platforms and services
- **Economic Freedom**: Enables direct creator-to-fan transactions

## Protocol Overview

RegistryAccord is structured around several core components:

1. **Identity Service**: Manages decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and authentication
2. **Creator Data Vault (CDV)**: Secure storage for creator content and data
3. **Gateway Service**: Provides read-side APIs for feeds, search, and discovery
4. **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface for interacting with the protocol
5. **Devstack**: Local development environment for testing and building
6. **Specifications**: Canonical protocol definitions and schemas

## Project Status

RegistryAccord is currently in **Phase 1: The Architect Phase**. The protocol and its implementations are under active development and should be considered in a draft state, subject to change.
