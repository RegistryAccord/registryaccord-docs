# Phase 1 Deliverables

The concrete outputs that will be completed in Phase 1, organized by service.

## Identity Service

### Core Features

- **DID Lifecycle**:
  - Create DID with EdDSA/Ed25519 keypair
  - Resolve DID to DID Document
  - Key rotation with overlap windows
  - Identity recovery (feature-flagged)

- **Authentication**:
  - Short-lived JWT session issuance via nonce challenge
  - JWKS exposure for public key discovery
  - Proper cache headers on JWKS endpoints

- **Security**:
  - TLS 1.3 enforcement
  - CORS policies
  - Key lifecycle management

- **Observability**:
  - Structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Comprehensive metrics for all key operations
  - Health check endpoints

### Quality Attributes

- **Performance**: 50ms p95 for DID resolution
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime target
- **Security**: Pass static analysis and dependency scans

## CDV Service

### Core Features

- **Record Management**:
  - Create records with schema validation
  - List records with deterministic pagination
  - Schema version persistence
  - Idempotency on record creation

- **Media Handling**:
  - Media upload with SHA-256 checksum verification
  - Media finalize with size persistence
  - Event emission for media finalization

- **Security**:
  - JWT-based authorization
  - Input validation and sanitization

- **Observability**:
  - Structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Metrics for all operations
  - Health check endpoints

### Quality Attributes

- **Performance**: 100ms p95 for record operations

- **Data Integrity**: 100% checksum verification

## Gateway Service

### Core Features

- **Feed APIs**:
  - Following feed with deterministic ordering
  - Author feed with deterministic ordering
  - Profile reads with optional counts

- **Search**:
  - Basic text search
  - Deterministic ordering

- **Security**:
  - JWT verification using Identity service JWKS
  - Anonymous reads for public queries
  - Authenticated reads for personalized feeds

- **Observability**:
  - Structured logging with correlation IDs
  - Metrics for all operations
  - Health check endpoints

### Quality Attributes

- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime target

## Devstack

### Core Features

- **Service Orchestration**:
  - Docker Compose setup for all services
  - Health-checked startup
  - Deterministic seeding (5 DIDs, 50 posts, 10 media, 30 interactions)

- **Developer Experience**:
  - Make targets for common operations (up, seed, demo, rotate-keys)
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Documentation and examples

### Quality Attributes

- **Reproducibility**: 5-minute demo from fresh clone
- **Reliability**: Consistent startup and seeding

## Conformance Suite

### Core Features

### Quality Attributes

- **Comprehensiveness**: â‰¥95% pass rate required
- **Reliability**: Consistent results across environments

## SDK

### Core Features

- **Client Library**:
  - RAClient with SessionManager
  - Identity module (createDid, resolveDid, getNonce, issueSession)
  - CDV module (createRecord, listRecords, media upload/finalize)
  - Gateway module (feedFollowing, feedAuthor, search, getProfile)

- **Utilities**:
  - Pagination utilities with async generators
  - Error model with proper mapping
  - Retry mechanism for 429/503 errors
  - JWKS helpers for key verification

### Quality Attributes

- **Usability**: Examples completing identity->session->post:create->list in less than or equal to 20 lines
- **Compatibility**: Node.js and browser entry points
- **Performance**: Minimal bundle size

## CLI

### Core Features

  - Feed interaction (following, author)
  - Search functionality
  - Profile lookup

- **UX Features**:
  - Deterministic exit codes (0,2,3,4,5)
  - JSON mode for CI
  - Media upload with checksum verification
  - Automatic retries with exponential backoff

### Quality Attributes

- **Reliability**: Five-minute demo script
- **Portability**: Cross-platform compatibility

## Documentation

### Core Features
