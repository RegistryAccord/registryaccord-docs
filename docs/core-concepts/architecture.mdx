# System Architecture

RegistryAccord is built on a **four-layer architecture** that separates concerns for maximum flexibility and interoperability.

## The Four Layers

### 1. Identity Layer
**Purpose:** Who are you, and what can you do?

**Components:**
- Decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
- WebAuthn/Passkey authentication
- OAuth2/OIDC authorization
- Granular consent management
- Organization & team management

**Why Separate:** Identity should be portable across apps. Your identity isn't tied to any single platform.

---

### 2. Content Layer
**Purpose:** What content exists, who owns it, and how can it be used?

**Components:**
- Structured, versioned content
- JSON-LD semantic metadata
- License attachment & enforcement
- Content collections
- Provenance tracking

**Why Separate:** Content should live independently of any single app. Publish once, distribute everywhere.

---

### 3. Discovery Layer
**Purpose:** How do users find content?

**Components:**
- Algorithmic feed generation
- Real-time event streaming
- Custom ranking algorithms
- Fairness scorecards & audits
- A/B testing framework

**Why Separate:** Algorithms should be transparent, auditable, and pluggable. No single "the algorithm."

---

### 4. Monetization Layer
**Purpose:** How do creators and builders earn?

**Components:**
- **Payments & Payouts:** Subscriptions, tips, splits
- **Revenue Services:** Ad marketplace, RTB, brand safety
- **Analytics:** Performance tracking with privacy

**Why Separate:** Revenue should be programmable and transparent. Creators control their economics.

## Supporting Services

### Storage Gateway
**Purpose:** Where does content actually live?

**Features:**
- Content-addressed storage (SHA-256)
- Multi-provider support (S3, IPFS, etc.)
- End-to-end encryption
- CDN integration

## Design Philosophy

### Separation of Concerns
Each layer has a single, well-defined purpose. This enables:
- **Composability:** Mix and match implementations
- **Competition:** Multiple providers per layer
- **Innovation:** Iterate independently

### Interoperability First
All interfaces are defined by **open specifications**, not implementations.
- Standard formats (OpenAPI, JSON-LD, OAuth2)
- Well-defined contracts
- Version negotiation

### Privacy by Design
Privacy isn't bolted on—it's fundamental:
- Granular consent at the Identity layer
- Purpose limitation in Analytics
- Differential privacy for aggregates
- Right to erasure across all layers

### Creator Ownership
Creators own:
- Their identity (portable DID)
- Their content (versioned, licensed)
- Their audience (consent-based)
- Their economics (programmable splits)

## Technical Standards

RegistryAccord builds on proven standards:

| Layer | Standards |
|-------|-----------|
| **Identity** | W3C DIDs, WebAuthn, OAuth 2.0, OIDC |
| **Content** | JSON-LD, Schema.org, Dublin Core |
| **Discovery** | OpenAPI 3.1, JSON Schema |
| **Monetization** | PCI DSS, IAB standards, OpenRTB |
| **All** | TLS 1.3, mTLS, W3C Trace Context |

## Service Specifications

All seven services have complete OpenAPI specifications available in the API Reference section of this documentation.
