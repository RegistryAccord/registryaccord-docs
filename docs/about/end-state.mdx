# End State

The target capabilities for RegistryAccord represent a comprehensive platform for creator-owned digital presence and economic empowerment.

## Target Capabilities

### DID Identity

Full support for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) as the foundation for portable digital identity. Creators maintain control over their identity across all applications and services.

### Schema-Governed Content

Structured content models that enable rich interoperability while maintaining flexibility. Content schemas define the structure and semantics of different types of creator content.

### Federated Discovery (Feeds/Search)

Distributed discovery mechanisms that allow users to find content and creators across the ecosystem without centralized gatekeepers.

### Fiat + Programmable Payments

Support for both traditional fiat payments and programmable money through cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, enabling diverse monetization strategies.

### Privacy and Moderation Patterns

Built-in mechanisms for privacy protection and content moderation that respect both creator autonomy and community standards.

## Phase 1 Non-Goals

To set clear expectations, Phase 1 explicitly does not include:

- Advanced payment systems beyond basic stubs
- Complex privacy features
- Sophisticated moderation tools
- Full federation across multiple implementations
- Production-ready scalability features

These capabilities are planned for future phases as the protocol matures and gains adoption.

## Success Metrics

The end state will be measured by:

- Number of active creators using RegistryAccord-based applications
- Interoperability between different implementations
- Economic value flowing through the ecosystem
- Developer adoption and application diversity
- User satisfaction and retention rates
