# Design Principles

These principles guide all design decisions in the RegistryAccord protocol.

## 1. Creator Ownership

**Creators own their work, their audience, and their economics.**

### What This Means:
- **Portable Identity:** Your identity works across all RegistryAccord apps
- **Content Control:** You decide licensing, versioning, and distribution
- **Economic Control:** You set prices, splits, and payment terms
- **Data Rights:** Export anytime, delete within 30 days

### How It's Enforced:
- DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) for portable identity
- JSON-LD metadata with explicit licensing
- Programmable revenue splits in the Payments layer
- GDPR-compliant right to erasure APIs

---

## 2. Privacy by Design

**Privacy isn't optional—it's fundamental.**

### What This Means:
- **Consent First:** No data collection without explicit, granular consent
- **Purpose Limitation:** Data used only for consented purposes
- **Minimal Collection:** Collect only what's needed
- **User Control:** Withdraw consent anytime, delete in 30 days

### How It's Enforced:
- Granular consent management at Identity layer
- Purpose tags on all event schemas
- Differential privacy for analytics aggregates
- Privacy budget enforcement to prevent re-identification

---

## 3. Interoperability Over Lock-In

**Open standards beat proprietary formats.**

### What This Means:
- **Standard Formats:** JSON-LD, OpenAPI, OAuth2, not custom protocols
- **Multiple Implementations:** Any conformant service can participate
- **No Vendor Lock-In:** Switch providers without losing data
- **Network Effects for All:** Ecosystem growth benefits everyone

### How It's Enforced:
- All APIs specified in OpenAPI 3.1
- Conformance testing for implementations
- Standard content formats (JSON-LD, Schema.org)
- OAuth2 scopes for interoperability

---

## 4. Transparency & Fairness

**Algorithms should be auditable, not black boxes.**

### What This Means:
- **Open Algorithm Parameters:** Ranking signals are documented
- **Independent Audits:** Third-party fairness audits required
- **Public Scorecards:** Bias metrics published for all rankers
- **Dispute Process:** Users can challenge unfair outcomes

### How It's Enforced:
- Fairness scorecard APIs (Feed Generator)
- Audit report schemas and validation
- Dispute submission and resolution workflows
- Public transparency requirements for certified rankers

---

## 5. Security First

**Zero Trust Architecture is non-negotiable.**

### What This Means:
- **Phishing-Resistant Auth:** WebAuthn/Passkey primary, passwords optional
- **Least Privilege:** Fine-grained OAuth2 scopes (60+)
- **Encrypted Transport:** TLS 1.3 everywhere, mTLS for service-to-service
- **Audit Everything:** Comprehensive audit logs for compliance

### How It's Enforced:
- WebAuthn as primary authentication method
- OAuth2 scope system with RBAC/ABAC
- mTLS for all inter-service communication
- Audit event APIs and tamper-evident logs

---

## 6. Composability

**Simple services, complex systems.**

### What This Means:
- **Single Responsibility:** Each service does one thing well
- **Loose Coupling:** Services interact via well-defined APIs
- **Mix and Match:** Use official services or roll your own
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Start simple, add complexity as needed

### How It's Enforced:
- Seven independent services with clear boundaries
- Standard API contracts (OpenAPI)
- No hidden dependencies between services
- Optional features (e.g., fairness audits are opt-in)

---

## 7. Developer Experience

**APIs should be intuitive and consistent.**

### What This Means:
- **Consistent Patterns:** Pagination, filtering, errors work the same everywhere
- **Self-Documenting:** OpenAPI specs, inline examples, generated SDKs
- **Predictable Errors:** RFC 7807 problem details, not random strings
- **Versioning:** Clear deprecation timeline (90 days notice)

### How It's Enforced:
- API design standards (Section 4 of specs)
- Automated OpenAPI validation (Spectral)
- Example workflows for all endpoints
- Deprecation header standards (RFC 8594)

---

## 8. Sustainability

**The protocol must be economically viable long-term.**

### What This Means:
- **Fair Marketplace Fees:** ~15% platform take (adjustable)
- **Transparent Economics:** Fees published, not hidden
- **Value Alignment:** Fees fund audits, governance, infrastructure
- **Foundation Model:** Long-term neutral stewardship

### How It's Enforced:
- Clear fee structure in payment APIs
- Audit fund allocation (1-3% of platform revenue)
- Planned transition to neutral foundation
- Community governance (RFC process)

---

## Trade-Offs We Accept

### Complexity for Flexibility
RegistryAccord has seven services and 114 endpoints. That's more complex than a monolithic platform, but it enables:
- Builders to use only what they need
- Competition at every layer
- Innovation without permission

### Specification Overhead
Writing OpenAPI specs takes time. But it enables:
- Auto-generated SDKs
- Conformance testing
- Clear contracts
- Multi-language support

### Governance Overhead
RFCs and TSC votes slow down changes. But they ensure:
- Community input
- Careful consideration
- Backward compatibility
- Long-term stability

## Anti-Principles

**What RegistryAccord is NOT:**

❌ **Move Fast and Break Things** - We value stability and compatibility  
❌ **Walled Garden** - Open standards, not proprietary lock-in  
❌ **Black Box Algorithms** - Transparency and auditability required  
❌ **Data Exploitation** - Privacy by design, not surveillance capitalism  
❌ **Winner-Take-All** - Ecosystem benefits shared among participants

## Living Principles

These principles evolve with the protocol through the **RFC process**:

1. Community member proposes principle change
2. 14-day public comment period
3. TSC votes (simple majority)
4. Documentation updated
