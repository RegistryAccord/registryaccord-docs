# RegistryAccord Documentation

This repository contains the source code for the official documentation website for the RegistryAccord protocol.

The site can be accessed at: [https://registryaccord.github.io/registryaccord-docs/](https://registryaccord.github.io/registryaccord-docs/)

## Overview

This site serves as the public documentation hub for the RegistryAccord project, an open protocol that enables creators to own their work, their audience, and the economics of their business.

Key features of RegistryAccord:
- **Creator Ownership**: Creators retain full ownership of their content, audience, and data
- **Decentralized Identity**: Built on DID (Decentralized Identifiers) for portable identity
- **Open Standards**: Based on open protocols and specifications
- **Interoperability**: Works across different platforms and services

## Recent Updates

The documentation site has been completely overhauled with:
- Comprehensive documentation for all RegistryAccord components
- New sections: About, Getting Started, Contributing
- Blog with welcome posts and technical guides
- Updated styling with brand colors
- GitHub Actions workflows for automated deployment
